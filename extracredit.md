### Spotify

Spotify's technology infrastructure is centered around addressing three key
obstacles such as Seamless music streaming by utilizing numerous servers
located in various places. Data storage with their own cloud-based architecture,
the Hub framework, Google Cloud, Docker, and Apache Storm. They also use
Python for music as well.

### Microsoft

The development of MS-Stack involves using different components or services
arranged in layers, which can be used to create software solutions for Microsoft's
applications such as Dynamics CRM, .NET, CRM Dynamics 365, SharePoint
development platform, Azure, and more. Microsoft stack is a vast collection of
platforms and frameworks, each with its own unique advantages and value. As a
company that provides full-stack Microsoft software development services, US
Cloud has a comprehensive understanding of various Microsoft technologies and
can create custom software using any of them. They also use visual studio code
which I use in the dev mountain program and plenty of other software engineers
that may use it as well.

### Amazon

Amazon's technology stack is based on the Linux operatingsystem, which
serves as the foundation for their data centers and cloud computing services.
The majority of Amazon's software development is carried out using Java, a
widely adopted and established programming language known for its security,
scalability, and robustness. They mainly use Java but another programming
language they use is Python. The language is mainly used for data analysis,
scientific computing, and scripting of course. A few other programming
languages that Amazon uses is C++ and Ruby. Amazon Web Services is
composed of various technologies, each serving a specific purpose. Java is
predominantly used for backend programming management. For data storage,
AWS primarily uses DynamoDB and MySQL, although there may be some
exceptions.
